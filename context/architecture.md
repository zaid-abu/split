## System Boundaries

| Area | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Route files, screen composition, navigation options |
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI only, no direct Supabase writes |
| `src/services/` | Supabase queries and mutations by domain |
| `src/lib/` | Shared clients, pure calculations, formatting, error helpers |
| `src/constants/` | Tokens, categories, currencies, fixed option sets |
| `src/hooks/` | UI-facing state composition and subscriptions |
| `src/types/` | Shared TypeScript types |
| `supabase/` | Migrations, policies, Edge Functions, seed data |

---

## Data Flow

### Read Flow

```
Screen
  ↓
Domain hook or service
  ↓
Supabase query
  ↓
Typed domain model
  ↓
Tokenized UI component
```

### Mutation Flow

```
User action
  ↓
Validate input locally
  ↓
Service mutation or Edge Function
  ↓
Postgres write in transaction where needed
  ↓
Activity row + notification rows
  ↓
Realtime update or query refresh
```

### Expense Balance Flow

```
Expense
  ↓
Expense participants and split rows
  ↓
Ledger entries
  ↓
Friend/group balance view
  ↓
Dashboard, analytics, settle-up suggestions
```

Balances must be derivable from ledger data. Cached totals are allowed only if they can be rebuilt.

## Storage Buckets

| Bucket | Path | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `avatars` | `{user_id}/avatar.{ext}` | Profile photos |
| `group-covers` | `{group_id}/cover.{ext}` | Group cover images |
| `receipts` | `{expense_id}/{file_id}.{ext}` | Receipt photos |
| `exports` | `{user_id}/{export_id}.{ext}` | CSV/PDF exports |

Access must be scoped by RLS policies and signed URLs where appropriate.

---

## Authentication

- Provider: Supabase Auth.
- Methods: email, phone OTP, Google OAuth, Apple OAuth.
- Auth state is initialized in the root layout.
- Protected groups: all tabs and domain detail routes.
- Public groups: splash, welcome, sign-in, verify.
- On first login, route to profile setup until `onboarding_completed = true`.

---

## Invariants

- Every Supabase read/write is scoped to the current user through RLS and query filters.
- Money is stored as numeric values with explicit currency. Never infer currency from locale.
- Balance views are derived from expenses, splits, and settlements.
- Mutations that affect multiple tables use a transaction or Supabase Edge Function.
- Expense edits increment `version` for conflict detection.
- Soft delete expenses and groups where historical balances depend on them.
- UI must show loading, empty, error, offline, and conflict states for production workflows.
